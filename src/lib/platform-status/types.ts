/**
 * Platform status contract — the shared shape every platform probe returns.
 *
 * This is the "all platforms" companion to `server-metrics.ts` (which is
 * host-centric: one Hetzner box + its Coolify apps).  Where server-metrics
 * answers "how is the box doing", this answers "how is every platform the
 * fleet depends on doing", one card per platform.
 *
 * Design rules every probe must honour:
 *  - Secrets never leave the server.  A probe reads credentials from env and
 *    returns only rendered, non-sensitive values.
 *  - A probe never throws.  Failures become a card with a state and an error
 *    code, so one dead upstream cannot blank the whole page.
 *  - Output is bounded: at most `MAX_PLATFORM_METRICS` metrics per card, each
 *    a short pre-formatted string.  No raw upstream payloads pass through.
 *  - Unconfigured is a first-class, non-alarming state — most people will not
 *    have every platform wired, and a missing token is not an outage.
