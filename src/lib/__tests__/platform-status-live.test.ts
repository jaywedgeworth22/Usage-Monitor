/**
 * Opt-in live probe harness — SKIPPED unless `PLATFORM_STATUS_LIVE=1`.
 *
 * Runs the real platform-status registry against whatever credentials are in
 * the environment and prints one line per platform.  It hits real third-party
 * APIs, so it must never run in CI or in the default suite — hence the
 * env-gated skip.
 *
 * Cards are secret-free by contract (see the "never emits a value that looks
 * like a credential" assertion in platform-status-registry.test.ts), so this
 * OUTPUT is safe.  The ENVIRONMENT it runs with is not: never print
 * `process.env` here, and redirect stderr away from anything that displays it.
 *
 * Run with:
 *   set -a; . ~/.secrets/global-api-keys; set +a
 *   PLATFORM_STATUS_LIVE=1 node_modules/.bin/vitest run \
 *     src/lib/__tests__/platform-status-live.test.ts
