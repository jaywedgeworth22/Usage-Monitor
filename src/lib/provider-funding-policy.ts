 * One-time cleanup, not a standing policy: at the time this shipped, no
 * LLM/AI provider needed ProviderPlan.mustKeepFunded set (all chat inference
 * routed through OpenRouter, so no direct LLM vendor — Anthropic, OpenAI,
 * DeepSeek, ... — was a hard production dependency). This boot-time pass
 * (same callsite as deactivateDecommissionedBuiltInProviders in
 * src/instrumentation.ts) clears any flag that predated that cleanup, then
 * records completion in AppSetting so it runs exactly once. The owner
 * remains in control of the flag afterward — PUT /api/providers/[id] and
 * POST /api/providers accept mustKeepFunded=true for any provider, and
 * nothing re-clears it once this marker exists.
 *
 * Returns the number of providers whose flag was cleared (0 on every call
 * after the first successful pass, including when the marker exists).
