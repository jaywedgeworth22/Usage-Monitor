# Periodic Litestream replica heartbeat for /api/ready's backup gate.
# Install this file root-owned as /usr/local/sbin/usage-monitor-replica-status
# and drive it with usage-monitor-replica-status.timer (10-minute cadence).
#
# /api/ready no longer trusts the startup-only LITESTREAM_ACTIVE env claim for
# a required backup (see getBackupRuntimeStatus in src/lib/runtime-health.ts):
# it demands this side-channel status file unless
# LITESTREAM_REPLICA_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED=false. This probe is the producer:
# it lists the newest Garage LTX object through the app container's own
# authenticated Litestream binary (the same per-level tip listing the deploy
# gate uses; never `-level all`, which timed out under Coolify load) and
# atomically writes a small JSON verdict where the app can read it.
#
# JSON contract (parsed by getBackupRuntimeStatus's JSON branch):
#   ok        - newest LTX object is younger than the freshness budget.
#   checkedAt - when THIS probe ran. Deliberately the only age signal the app
#               consumes: if this probe stops running, now-checkedAt grows past
#               LITESTREAM_REPLICA_MAX_AGE_SECONDS and readiness fails closed
#               with replica_status_stale. `ageSeconds` is intentionally NOT
#               written - the app prefers it over checkedAt, and a frozen
#               ageSeconds in a stale file would pass forever.
#   ltxAgeSeconds / reason - operator observability only; ignored by the app.
