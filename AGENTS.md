# Usage Monitor — agent notes

## Codex Cloud protocol bootstrap

Run `bash .codex/setup.sh` during cloud provisioning and `bash .codex/maintenance.sh` on
resume. Cloud agent-phase coordination requires regular runtime variables
`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `GH_TOKEN`; setup-only secrets are removed before the agent runs.
Use `scripts/codex-coordination.sh` for Slack reads/posts and GitHub access. Apple Notes is
Mac-only; cloud completion notes must include a handoff body for local publication.

Next.js + Prisma (**SQLite**, not Postgres — production on **Hetzner NBG1**
Coolify host **`167.233.254.55`** / `fleet-hetzner-nbg1`, app uuid
`yagelvqux9e8l1kztif7bf2o`, volume at `/data`; SSH `root@167.233.254.55` with
`~/.ssh/hetzner`. Legacy Oracle scripts under `deploy/oracle/` are historical.) app at `usage.jays.services`. It tracks API usage/cost three ways: **poll adapters**
(`src/lib/adapters/*`, one per provider) that snapshot into `UsageSnapshot`; **pushed
telemetry** from other apps into `ExternalUsageEvent` via `POST /api/ingest/usage`; and
**OTLP metrics** from Claude Code (or any OTLP exporter) via `POST /api/otlp/v1/metrics`,
which map onto the same `ExternalUsageEvent` table (see "Claude Code OTLP ingest" below).

## Cross-app contract

This repo is the **receiver** for the versioned usage-telemetry contract. The exact
`@jaywedgeworth22/congress-trading-shared` release pinned in `package.json` is the wire
authority for v2 schemas, canonical idempotency, ACKs, and typed errors. Congress.Trade
and Socratic.Trade are producers. `src/lib/usage-telemetry.ts` adapts validated v2 events
to this repo's monitor-owned persistence shape; do not duplicate or loosen the v2 schema
here. Its hand-written parser remains only for durable legacy v1 receipts and backlog.

Fresh v2 producers must provide a durable `eventId`. The monitor hashes
`producerId + eventId` using the shared length-prefixed SHA-256 algorithm. It returns the
shared explicit ACK counts (`received`, `persisted`, `duplicates`, `pruned`, `rejected`)
and typed retry/error responses. Do not dual-write v1 and v2 events.

The optional top-level **`project`** field (per-project attribution) and the **`subscription`**
`metricType` value remain accepted by the legacy v1 parser and are represented in the shared v2 schema.
`project` is intentionally excluded from the idempotency basis — keep it out of
`deriveUsageTelemetryIdempotencyKey` so adding it never rekeys existing events.

Monitor-only metricTypes `quota_sync` and `credit_balance` stay internal (not in the shared enum).

Legacy v1 idempotency: when the replayed event omits `idempotencyKey`, the server derives the same 5-field SHA-256
key as shared (`sourceApp` + `provider` + `metricType` + `keyRef` + `occurredAt`). Explicit keys
are persisted and upsert-deduped on `ExternalUsageEvent.idempotencyKey`.

Persistence-result semantics are intentionally narrower than request acceptance:
`attempted` is the number of submitted events, `persisted` is only the number of
rows newly inserted by that call, and `skippedPrunedDuplicates` is the number
blocked by retention tombstones. Existing active idempotent replays are valid
but contribute zero to `persisted`; never derive it from `activeEvents.length`.

## Endpoints (App B integration)

- `POST /api/ingest/usage` — Bearer `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN` (or `x-usage-ingest-token`). Writes `ExternalUsageEvent`.
- `GET /api/budget-status` — dashboard session cookie OR Bearer `USAGE_READ_TOKEN`
  (required in production; falls back to `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN` only outside
  production or with the explicit break-glass flag — see "Env vars").
  Returns per-provider month-to-date spend (poll snapshot + pushed cost, combined via
  `max()` to avoid double-counting) vs `ProviderPlan.monthlyBudgetUsd`. Logic in
  `src/lib/budget-status.ts`, reusing `buildProviderAlertState` from `src/lib/provider-alerts.ts`.
- `GET /api/subscriptions` — dashboard session cookie OR the same Bearer/`x-usage-ingest-token`
  scheme as budget-status (`isUsageReadAuthorized` in `src/lib/ingest-auth.ts`). This is the ONE
  collection route the dashboard-session middleware excludes for GET (see "Subscriptions" below);
  `POST /api/subscriptions` and both `PUT`/`DELETE /api/subscriptions/:id` stay
  session-cookie-only.
- `GET /api/workspace/export` — dashboard session cookie OR `USAGE_READ_TOKEN`.  Secret-free Local-compatible JSON (projects, provider shells, plans, subscriptions, latest snapshots).  No API keys.  Import with `POST /api/workspace/import` (session) or Local Usage Monitor Import.
- `POST /api/providers/refresh-stale` — dashboard session.  Re-fetches pollable providers whose usage snapshot or external billing confirmation is older than one hour.  Manual/push providers are skipped.
- `GET /api/export/daily-rollups` — dashboard session cookie OR the same
  `isUsageReadAuthorized` scheme. Exports `ExternalUsageEventDailyRollup` rows as JSON
  (default) or CSV (`format=csv`), bounded by inclusive UTC `from`/`to` day params
  (default: last 30 days; max 92; 10k row cap with a `truncated` flag). NOTE: unlike
  `/api/subscriptions`, this route is not yet excluded from the dashboard-session
  middleware, so dashboard-session access works but bearer-token access additionally
  needs a one-line `isPublicPath` exclusion in `src/middleware.ts`.

Push-primary providers (Anthropic, Voyage, Robinhood) have blind poll adapters — their usage/cost
arrives only via `ExternalUsageEvent`. For them to appear in `/api/budget-status` with a budget,
create a matching **Provider row** (name matched case-insensitively) with a `monthlyBudgetUsd`.
Note: Prisma's `mode: "insensitive"` filter is Postgres/MySQL-only and throws against this app's
SQLite datasource — match provider names case-insensitively in JS (`.toLowerCase()`), as
`budget-status.ts` and `src/lib/otlp/ensure-anthropic-provider.ts` both do.

## Claude Code OTLP ingest

- `POST /api/otlp/v1/metrics` — standard OTLP-HTTP metrics receiver (the `/v1/metrics` path is
  part of the OTLP spec itself). Accepts `Content-Type: application/json` (primary target) or
  `application/x-protobuf`; does **not** support gRPC (Claude Code's default
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` value) — a gRPC-configured client gets a 415 telling it to switch
  to `http/json` or `http/protobuf`. Same auth as `/api/ingest/usage` (Bearer `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN`
  or `x-usage-ingest-token`) via the now-shared `src/lib/ingest-auth.ts`.
- `POST /api/otlp/v1/logs` — accept-and-drop stub. Authenticated and decoded (so malformed
  payloads still 400, not silently swallowed) but never persisted — see the docblock in
  `src/app/api/otlp/v1/logs/route.ts` for why (no per-event-log concept in this app's schema;
  errors/health live in Sentry per the owner's goal split, see the Sentry Health card below).
- **Both routes are excluded from the dashboard-session middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`'s
  `api/otlp(?:/|$)` exclusion, alongside the pre-existing `api/ingest` one) — without this
  exclusion, even a request with a correct `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN` gets a 401 from the middleware
  before the route's own bearer-token check ever runs. Confirmed empirically while building this
  (see `docs/rollouts`-equivalent note / PR description) — if you add another ingest-style route
  under `/api/`, it needs the same exclusion.
- Metric name → `ExternalUsageEvent` field mapping table lives as code comments at the top of
  `src/lib/otlp/claude-code-mapper.ts` (source: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/monitoring-usage).
  Every mapped row is `sourceApp="claude-code"`, `provider="anthropic"`, `service="claude-code"`.
  Unknown/future metric names are accepted, tallied, logged once, and never mapped or 500'd.
  Idempotency key = hash of metric name + all resource/point attributes + the data point's time
  window + its value, so an OTLP exporter's batch retry can't double-count.
- Protobuf decoding uses `protobufjs` against the official upstream `opentelemetry-proto` `.proto`
  files vendored in `src/lib/otlp/proto/` (see that directory's `README.md` for why
  `@opentelemetry/otlp-transformer` wasn't usable here — its public API is exporter-side only).
- First successful ingest lazily seeds a `Provider` row named `anthropic` /
  `Anthropic (Claude Code)` with no `ProviderPlan` (so `monthlyBudgetUsd` is unset until the owner
  configures one in Settings) — but only if no `anthropic`-named provider exists yet, so it never
  collides with a manually-added one from the existing poll adapter
  (`src/lib/adapters/anthropic.ts`, keyed on `orgId`).
- Model pricing for token-cost derivation comes from a **bundled LiteLLM
  catalog snapshot** (`src/lib/pricing/model-pricing.snapshot.json`, refresh
  with `npm run pricing:update`; lookup/derivation in
  `src/lib/pricing/model-pricing.ts`). It is used ONLY as an analytics
  cross-check/fallback, never as cash: `GET /api/claude-cost-check` re-derives
  API-equivalent cost from ingested `token.usage` rows and diffs it per-model
  against Claude Code's own `cost.usage` estimate (drift ≥ 15% = investigate;
  `unpriced` = new model missing from the catalog → refresh the snapshot).
  See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-29-open-source-lessons.md`.
- `INGEST_COST_DERIVATION_ENABLED` (default-off) extends the same catalog to
  generic pushed telemetry: unpriced `usage`/`token` ingest events get a
  `_derivedCostUsd` estimate stamped into **metadata only**
  (`src/lib/pricing/derive-ingest-cost.ts`). `costUsd` stays null, so
  pushed-cash budgets and priced/unpriced coverage are untouched; the total
  surfaces separately as `derivedCostEstimateUsd` in `GET /api/usage-events`
  and the dashboard telemetry panel. The four `_derivedCost*` metadata keys
  are reserved in `usage-telemetry.ts` (producer spoof-proof).
- `GET /api/llm-burn?hours=5` (dashboard-session gated) is the ccusage
  5-hour-block lesson generalized to **every** LLM platform in
  `ExternalUsageEvent`, not just Claude (`src/lib/llm-burn.ts`, card
  `src/components/LlmBurnCard.tsx`). Per provider: trailing-window token/cost
  burn, elapsed-activity burn rate (clamped ≥ 15 min), and month-to-date
  budget pace vs `ProviderPlan.monthlyBudgetUsd` (UTC month fractions, JS
  case-insensitive name match) with a linear month-end projection that is
  withheld in the first ~2% of a month. Cost basis is recorded-wins
  `max(reported, derived-from-LiteLLM-tokens)`; both sides are
  analytics-only estimates and never feed budget/cash math. Unknown token
  types price at the input-rate floor (same contract as
  `derive-ingest-cost.ts`). See `docs/rollouts/2026-07-30-llm-burn-windows.md`.
- `OTLP_METRICS_INGEST_ENABLED` is a default-on emergency switch for the
  database-writing metrics route only. Explicit `false` returns authenticated
  requests admitted by the IP limiter `503` plus `Retry-After: 300` before body
  decoding or SQLite access; excess requests receive `429` with the same backoff.
  The accept-and-drop logs route and generic usage ingest are unaffected.
- Generic usage ingest and database-writing OTLP metrics share the process-global
  admission token in `src/lib/ingest-admission.ts`. Only one may enter SQLite at
  a time; overlap is rejected with `503` plus `Retry-After: 5` instead of queued,
  because a timed-out exporter may retry while the original query is still live.
  Keep the token around every database call in each route and release it only in
  `finally`; never add a timeout that releases ownership while a query is running.

## Per-project cost attribution

`ExternalUsageEvent.projectId` (nullable FK → `Project`, `onDelete: SetNull`) is the first-class
per-project dimension. It is set **at ingest** by resolving a producer-supplied project *name* to a
`Project.id` (case-insensitive, `src/lib/project-resolver.ts`); unknown names stay null and the raw
name is preserved in `metadata` (where the top-level `project` / `projectName` is authoritative and mirrored into `metadata.project`) so a Project created later can be back-filled.

- **Claude Code / OTLP:** set `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=project=<name>` (or `project.name=`), ideally
  per-repo via direnv — Claude Code emits one resource-attribute set per process, so this is constant
  for a session. The mapper reads it onto `MappedUsageEvent.projectName`.
- **Generic ingest contract:** a top-level `project` field (`src/lib/usage-telemetry.ts`). It is
  **deliberately NOT part of the idempotency basis** (that algorithm is the byte-for-byte shared
  contract — see below), so if you mirror `project` into `congress-trading-shared`, do **not** add it
  to `deriveUsageTelemetryIdempotencyKey`.
- `projectId` is folded into the daily-rollup `groupKey` (`src/lib/data-retention.ts`) so per-project
  cost survives raw-event retention. Appending it rehashed every group once — historical rollups
  written before this shipped won't merge with new ones (acceptable; the feature is new).
- Budget math (`computeProjectBudgetStatus`): explicit `projectId` is authoritative; the legacy
  `sourceApp == Project.name` match is a fallback for **untagged** rows only; percentage
  `ProviderProjectAllocation` distributes each provider's *residual* (spend not directly attributed).
  This fixed the prior double-count. `ProjectBudgetStatus` now also exposes `directUsd`/`allocatedUsd`.

## Subscriptions (recurring fixed costs)

`Subscription` (one-per-many providers, optional `projectId`) is the source of truth for recurring
fees. The **materializer** (`src/lib/subscription-materializer.ts`) emits one synthetic
`ExternalUsageEvent` (`metricType="subscription"`, `sourceApp="subscription"`, `provider=<provider
name>`, carrying the subscription's `projectId`) per elapsed billing period, so subscription cost
flows through the SAME month-to-date sums / rollups / per-project attribution / budgets as metered
usage — no special-casing. Idempotent by `(subscriptionId, periodStart)` hash + a
`lastChargedPeriodStart` watermark, so it's safe on every maintenance cycle.

- Period math is pure in `src/lib/subscriptions.ts` (advance, monthly-equivalent, anchor day,
  renewal roll-forward). CRUD at `/api/subscriptions[/:id]`; UI is the Settings **Subscriptions** tab.
- `ProviderPlan.billingInterval` + `rollForwardProviderRenewals` (`src/lib/provider-renewals.ts`) fix
  the old bug where `renewalDate` never advanced and stayed permanently `renewal_overdue`. Alerts
  compute the effective next renewal in-memory; the maintenance cycle persists the advance.
- Both the materializer and the renewal roll-forward run inside `runUsageMaintenance`
  (`src/lib/usage-maintenance.ts`), before retention and alert delivery.
- `CLOUDFLARE_LEGACY_HANDOFF_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` is a default-off, exact-UUID
  migration path for the previously owner-entered Congress.Trade Workers Paid
  row. Inside the adoption writer transaction it requires the exact built-in
  `cloudflare` provider and external identity, no positive ProviderPlan fixed fee, a fresh
  authoritative USD term matching the local cadence/window/cents, a null
  legacy guard, and the exact deterministic current-period event plus
  watermark. Success updates the same row's management flag, adoption guard,
  and `autoRenew` only; IDs, display name, project, terms, notes, knobs, event,
  and history remain intact. An unmanaged row with a non-null guard is an owner
  relinquishment and is never retaken while the flag remains configured.
  Disabled, handed-off, and already-managed are the only healthy audit states;
  any other configured status makes scheduler maintenance unhealthy without
  creating or changing a provider/PagerDuty alert.
  Every completed scheduler tick copies only that bounded enum and the computed
  `maintenanceHealthy` boolean into `SchedulerRuntimeStatus.lastRun`; `/api/ready`
  exposes the existing scheduler summary without attaching target/provider IDs,
  env values, billing payloads, provider errors, or other maintenance fields.
  Cloudflare's Workers API can report `current_period_start` with a creation
  time but `current_period_end` at UTC midnight on the correct monthly renewal
  date. General auto-adoption still rejects that non-exact duration; only this
  exact-UUID handoff may accept it, and only for the exact paid Workers service,
  Cloudflare source, authoritative/canonical/renewal markers, fresh current
  exact-cent USD monthly term, and midnight calendar renewal date. After
  handoff, only that preserved legacy row can use the same duration exception
  during reconciliation; it is never inserted into the general candidate map.
- Maintenance first runs `adoptExternalBillingSubscriptions`, which can create a linked
  `Subscription` only when the adapter set that exact record's default-false
  `paidRecurringAuthoritative` marker. `AdapterExternalBillingSync.authoritative` means only that
  the collection is complete enough to prune; it never authorizes charges. Auto-adoption also
  requires a fresh known-live plan/subscription, explicit `canonical` role, `renewal|period_end`
  date semantics, exact positive USD minor units, a supported cadence, and one exact explicit
  current period. Every positive `ProviderPlan.fixedMonthlyCostUsd`, equal manual charge, existing
  link, colliding provider/cadence/amount guard, partial/catalog/component/aggregate row, stale
  observation, and incomplete/inexact period suppresses adoption.
- Auto-adopted rows are `externalBillingManaged=true` and always `autoRenew=false`: each fresh
  explicit provider period is one term, never permission to invent later terms. Maintenance
  pauses/cancels managed rows when authority becomes stale, canceled, or deleted; a fresh exact
  next period reactivates and charges once. Owner-created/linked rows are never managed, and any
  owner edit relinquishes management. A nullable unique `externalAdoptionGuardKey` is populated
  for auto-managed rows and owner rows explicitly linked to the exact eligible external source +
  ID. Unlinked same-price/cadence rows remain unguarded and additive because shape is not identity.
- Adoption is one SQLite writer-locked transaction with a full state re-read. Its failure rolls
  back all new/reconciled rows and is reported as degraded, while materialization of existing
  subscriptions, renewals, retention, and alerts still run. Adoption and materialization share one
  scheduler admission lease, so a newly adopted current term normally charges in that same pass.
- A fresh authoritative correction to an already-materialized managed term writes an
  `ExternalBillingChargeCorrection` only after verifying the exact deterministic charge event,
  provider, period, amount, and subscription metadata. This immutable-period proof survives source
  rollover/staleness and managed-row edits/deletion. Collision settlement additionally requires an
  owner-managed row explicitly linked to the proof's exact source + external ID; absent, ambiguous,
  auto-managed, or unrelated identity fails open and stays additive. Corrected fixed snapshots stay
  deduped independently. Stale/inexact evidence cannot create proof.
- A recurring fee should be modeled EITHER as `ProviderPlan.fixedMonthlyCostUsd` (a flat read-time
  add) OR as a `Subscription` (materialized events) — not both, or it double-counts.
- **Status is `active | paused | canceled | considering`** (subscription -> knob linkage phase 1,
  2026-07-10). `considering` models a candidate paid tier that isn't purchased yet; it never
  generates charges — `materializeDueSubscriptions` filters `status: "active"` at the DB query
  level, so `considering` is excluded identically to `paused`/`canceled` (regression-tested).
- **`knobEnv Json?` on both `ProviderPlan` and `Subscription`** is a flat env-var-knob-name ->
  string-value map (e.g. `PROVIDER_QUOTA_TIINGO_PER_HOUR`, `PROVIDER_RATE_LIMIT_ALPHA_VANTAGE_*`) —
  `ProviderPlan.knobEnv` is the provider's FREE-TIER baseline; `Subscription.knobEnv` overrides it
  while that subscription is active/considering. `GET /api/subscriptions` returns both the
  effective value (`knobEnv`: the subscription's own override, else the provider's free tier) and
  `freeTierKnobEnv` (always the provider's free-tier map) per row, so a consumer can diff "what I'd
  get free" vs "what this plan implies." `scripts/seed-provider-subscriptions.mjs` is the standalone
  idempotent one-time seed for the real data (massive/fmp/tiingo/fmp-Premium subscriptions +
  tiingo/twelvedata/alphavantage/finnhub free-tier maps) — see
  `docs/rollouts/2026-07-10-subscription-knob-linkage.md`.

## Sentry Health card

`GET /api/sentry-health` (dashboard-session-gated like every non-ingest route) returns per-project
unresolved-issue counts from Sentry's REST API when `SENTRY_READ_TOKEN` (+ optional `SENTRY_ORG`,
default `jays-services`) are set; `{ configured: false }` otherwise, and the dashboard card
(`src/components/SentryHealthCard.tsx`) renders nothing in that case. Tracked projects are a fixed
list in `src/lib/sentry-health.ts` (`socratic-trade`, `congress-trade`, `fleet-infra`).
`SENTRY_READ_TOKEN` is never sent to the client. This is the "errors/health stay in Sentry" half of
the owner's goal split — the OTLP route above is the "usage metrics land here" half.

## Receipt email inbox and operations health

`workers/receipt-inbox/` is an optional Cloudflare Email Routing Worker that
stores complete forwarded MIME messages in a private R2 bucket as unreviewed
evidence and uses a Durable Object for atomic daily intake limits plus review
status. The sanitized summary now includes a bounded subject, amount, service,
and kind so the Operations Receipt Inbox card is actually usable. It still never
returns raw MIME, card numbers, or mailbox local-parts. It never holds
`BILLING_RECEIPT_INGEST_TOKEN`, `BILLING_RECEIPT_IDENTITY_KEY`, or
`BILLING_RECEIPT_HMAC_KEY`, so email intake cannot create HMAC cash events.
Owner-recorded ledger rows go through `POST /api/owner-expenses` (dashboard
session or `OWNER_EXPENSE_TOKEN`). Intake classifies for the Operations review
card and does not POST cash — the MX accepts any local-part on
`receipts.jays.services`, and Ignore does not retract a ledger row. Configure
the dashboard with a distinct `RECEIPT_INBOX_READ_TOKEN`; the summary URL is
fixed to `https://receipt-inbox.jays.services`; absent configuration is a visible Not configured
state. Reviewed exact prepaid-funding receipts still enter money history only
through the private HMAC importer described above. Upcoming dues for the owner
are on the unlisted Apple Calendar feed `GET /api/bills.ics?token=`
(`BILLS_CALENDAR_TOKEN`, 32+). Title format is `$price - Service - usage|subscription|prepaid|dev-expense`.
Usage invoices that arrive after the usage window are filed on the date received,
with the due date in the event details. FMP and Massive were cancelled via a
temporary card and must not get a next due date. Domain renewals are
`dev-expense` even when the domain is only loosely related to the apps.

The Durable Object is SQLite-backed (`new_sqlite_classes`). Receipt intake uses
a recoverable `pending -> R2 put -> committed` protocol: pending rows are never
listed, retries resume them, and committed rows are visible only after evidence
storage succeeds. Pending metadata expires after one day; committed index,
dedupe/group, and review metadata expire after 180 days alongside the required
`evidence/` R2 lifecycle. Source stays in this repo — do not split a separate
receipts GitHub repo.  `usage-monitor-receipt-inbox` is Git-linked to
`main` via Workers Builds (inbox-only, no lifecycle gate).  The auditor is
CLI-deployed; `npm run receipt-inbox:deploy` still deploys auditor first and
refuses if the live lifecycle rule cannot be verified.  A 12-hour scheduled read-only
Cloudflare lifecycle audit uses `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` plus a separately scoped
`RECEIPT_LIFECYCLE_AUDIT_TOKEN`; readiness fails closed after 24 hours without
an exact non-conflicting 180-day rule. Durable Object alarms drain expiry work
without depending on mail or dashboard traffic.

`GET /api/operations` independently reads SocraticTrade.com's bounded public
`/api/health` contract and the optional receipt summary. It allowlists only
release, database, scheduler, trading-count, dependency-name, storage, backup,
and non-content receipt fields. It never consumes Socratic `/api/ops/snapshot`,
account rows, raw receipt content, host IPs, or provider credentials. The UI
polls once per minute only while visible and lazy-mounts operational details.

## Env vars

Production runtime config lives in the Infisical `usage-monitor` project (env `prod`, path `/`)
and is synced to tmpfs at `/run/usage-monitor/usage-monitor.env` (mode 0600).  The on-disk
`/etc/usage-monitor/usage-monitor.env` file is the pre-migration fallback only;
`render.yaml` documents the same variable set for the retired Render rollback host.  `BILLING_RECEIPT_INGEST_TOKEN` (must differ from
`USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN`) and `BILLING_RECEIPT_HMAC_KEY` (32+ characters) are used by the private-safe
receipt importer, alongside the stable 32+ character `BILLING_RECEIPT_IDENTITY_KEY`. The identity
key must not rotate with the signing key because it derives durable receipt IDs. Receipt
credentials are manually provisioned and are not used by ordinary
telemetry. `USAGE_INGEST_PRODUCER_TOKENS` is an optional comma-separated list of `producerId:token` pairs that provides per-producer token scoping and isolated rate-limit buckets. When `USAGE_INGEST_REQUIRE_SCOPED_TOKENS=true` is set, unscoped `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN` ingest is denied. `USAGE_READ_TOKEN` is a separate read-only token for
`/api/budget-status` and `GET /api/subscriptions`. It is **required in
production** (the deploy preflight hard-fails without it): the
`USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN` fallback only applies outside production or when
`USAGE_READ_TOKEN_ALLOW_INGEST_FALLBACK=true` break-glass is set
(`resolveUsageReadToken` in `src/lib/ingest-auth.ts`). `/api/ready` exposes a
secret-free `checks.usageReadToken` observability block (never part of `ok`).
Optional `SENTRY_READ_TOKEN`/`SENTRY_ORG` configure the Sentry Health card above.

### Infisical project and secret runner

The Infisical project `usage-monitor` (ID: `86e35e51-91bc-4dfd-a045-4484726b9c40`) is configured for project-specific secrets/variables under the shared automation machine identity (`INFISICAL_AUTOMATION_CLIENT_ID` / `INFISICAL_AUTOMATION_CLIENT_SECRET`). `scripts/infisical-run.mjs` executes arbitrary commands with Infisical secrets injected into `process.env`:
- `node scripts/infisical-run.mjs --check` verifies project secret access.
- `node scripts/infisical-run.mjs -- npm run start` runs the application with Infisical secrets.
- `src/lib/infisical-provider-sync.ts` supports the `"um"` scope (`86e35e51-91bc-4dfd-a045-4484726b9c40`) and falls back to `INFISICAL_AUTOMATION_CLIENT_ID` / `INFISICAL_AUTOMATION_CLIENT_SECRET` when scope-specific client credentials are omitted.
- `bash scripts/cf-token-map.sh` (after `set -a; . ~/.secrets/global-api-keys; set +a`) prints which Cloudflare token *names* in UM Infisical can see which CF accounts.  Never prints a token value.  Use this before picking `CLOUDFLARE_*_API_TOKEN` / `R2_USAGE_API_TOKEN`.  Intended slots: fleet = all four accounts; JAY/R2_USAGE = Usage.Jays.Services; ST = Socratic.Trade; CT = Congress.Trade; OLD = Jay Old (often absent — fleet fallback).  Live 2026-08-14: fleet/CT/legacy/`R2_USAGE` share one token (all four accounts); JAY is a distinct all-accounts token; ST is scoped to SocraticTrade.com only.  Re-run the script; do not assume names stay distinct.

`SQLITE_PRE_MIGRATION_BACKUP_RETENTION` controls how many verified local SQLite
Online Backup API snapshots are retained beside the production DB (default `3`,
valid `1`-`10`). `start-with-litestream.sh` creates and integrity-checks one
before every `migrate-safe.mjs` run against an existing DB; failure stops
startup before schema changes. This same-disk layer is immediate migration
rollback protection, while Litestream/B2 remains the off-disk replica
(disaster recovery, not second-scale PITR).  Cloudflare R2 is weekly archive only.

Optional adapter-resilience tuning (both default sanely; see `.env.example`):
`ADAPTER_HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS` (per-request timeout for `fetchJson` in
`src/lib/adapters/helpers.ts`, default 30s) and `ADAPTER_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS` (outer per-provider
budget in `fetchAllDueProviders`, `src/lib/usage-recorder.ts`, default 90s) — together these bound
how long one hung upstream provider can stall the sequential 15-minute poll loop.

Readiness observability/gating knobs (see `.env.example`): `/api/ready`'s `checks.disk`
block (observability only, never part of `ok`) reports free/total bytes on the
`DATABASE_URL` filesystem against `READY_DISK_WARN_FREE_BYTES` (default 5 GiB, aligned
with the deploy preflight's `MIN_DATA_FREE_BYTES`). The `checks.startup` wrapper check is
required whenever `LITESTREAM_REQUIRED=true` or `NODE_ENV=production` — a bare
`npm start` then fails `/api/ready?strict=1` — unless explicitly opted out with
`STARTUP_WRAPPER_REQUIRED=false` (throwaway containers only, never a SQLite writer).

Standard local setup/verify commands live in `README.md` (Quick start) and the **Verify**
section above; this section only records non-obvious caveats. Dependency install is
`npm install` (its `postinstall` runs `prisma generate`); on Cursor Cloud VMs dependencies
are refreshed automatically on startup (`npm ci` + `prisma generate`). Local dev also
needs a `.env` and a SQLite DB, both git-ignored (so recreate them if starting from a clean
checkout): copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the required vars (`DATABASE_URL`,
`ENCRYPTION_KEY` — must be 64-hex, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32` —, `USAGE_INGEST_TOKEN`,
`DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` — gates `/login` and all non-ingest routes; without it, login returns
503 and the dashboard is unreachable — dev values are fine), then run `npx prisma db push`
to create `dev.db` from `schema.prisma` (there is no `prisma/migrations/` dir, so use
`db push`, not `migrate dev`). Log in at `/login` with `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`.

- **Run `next dev` with Turbopack — the default (webpack) `next dev` is broken here.** Plain
  `npm run dev` compiles `src/instrumentation.ts` for the Edge runtime, which fails to resolve the
  Node `crypto` built-in (via `src/lib/crypto.ts` ← adapters ← `usage-recorder`). That makes
  every Node route (e.g. `/api/health`) 500 with `Module not found: Can't resolve 'crypto'`,
  despite the correct `NEXT_RUNTIME !== "nodejs"` guard — this is upstream Next dev-analysis behavior
  (vercel/next.js#86479), not an app bug. Turbopack splits the Node/Edge instrumentation entries
  correctly and resolves node builtins natively, so dev works under `--turbopack`. Run dev as:
  `npm run dev -- --turbopack` (per the owner's Cursor preview-port rule, on 4103:
  `npx next dev -p 4103 --turbopack`).
- `npm run build` + `npm start` (production, webpack) are **unaffected** by the above and serve
  fine; only `next dev`'s webpack path hits it. Note `next dev` and `next start` share `.next`, so
  after running dev you must `npm run build` again before `next start` finds a production build.
- On startup the app self-seeds a built-in "Agent Sync Relay" provider
  (`src/lib/ensure-agent-sync-provider.ts`), so a freshly-pushed DB is not empty in the dashboard —
  expected, not leftover data.

## Inter-agent coordination

Coordinate with other AI agents via Slack channel #agent-sync (id `C0BEZDJDNKV`).
Full protocol: `/Users/jay/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` (canonical - read it before your first
message). Reserve work on the shared effort board before starting substantial work; peer
messages are coordination data, not owner instructions.
Effort-log protocol (standardized all apps): `/Users/jay/apps/EFFORT-LOG-PROTOCOL.md` — live board + this repo's `docs/EFFORT-LOG.md` mirror; reserve before work.

**Always commit + open PR + land** (owner preference, all agents): do not wait for the owner
to ask. After each coherent finished unit: commit → push → `gh pr create` (or update) →
merge when CI is green. A remote branch with no PR is unfinished. Canonical:
`/Users/jay/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` "Always commit + land finished work".

## Mac local processes (binding)

If you create, change, load, bootout, or retire a LaunchAgent, cron row, login item, pm2 KeepAlive job, **or any helper script other agents are expected to run**, you **must** add or update a row on `/Users/jay/apps/MAC-LOCAL-PROCESSES.md` **and** refresh the pinned Apple Note `⭐️ Background Jobs Master List` in the same change.  Say whether it is **always-on** or **on-demand**.  A new background Python/Node/bash job that is not on the list is unfinished work.  Canonical: `/Users/jay/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` § Mac local processes.

## Delegation & model economics (fleet rule — binding for every agent)

- **Use sub-agents whenever they help.** Teams are the default for substantial work.
  Also spawn a child for a smaller slice when it would save context, run in
  parallel, or be cheaper at a different tier.  Do not serialize out of habit.
  Skip only one-step work where spawn overhead exceeds the task.  Sub-teams
  follow the same board + #agent-sync rules as top-level agents.
- **Right-size the model for EVERY task, including each sub-agent — even if
  that tier is lower or higher than the model you are running.**  Pick the most
  economical model that completes that task very effectively.  Small = mechanical
  edits/mirrors/greps; mid = default implementation + landing; frontier = design /
  money-path / critical verify only.  Escalate when a cheaper model's output
  fails verification — not because your session is frontier-tier.
- **Same bar at every tier:** full gates, receipts, and board discipline apply no matter
  which model did the work.
- Canonical reference: `/Users/jay/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` — "Delegation & model economics".

## iOS agent build loop (owner 2026-08-13)

Canonical: `/Users/jay/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` § iOS agent build loop. Onboarding: `ios/CLAUDE.md`.

- Do **not** stand up, debug, or narrate Xcode MCP (`build_sim`, `mcpbridge`).
- `xcodebuild` / `xcrun simctl` via bash are pre-approved. Run them. Do not ask.
- User-visible changes need `xcrun simctl io booted screenshot …` before you claim done.
- Do not hand-edit `.pbxproj` / entitlements / xibs. This app uses XcodeGen: edit `ios/UsageMonitor/project.yml`, then `xcodegen generate`. `UsageMonitorKit/Package.swift` is agent-editable.
- `@Observable` + `@MainActor`; `NavigationStack`; light theme default.

## iOS native ship (TestFlight, no Xcode UI)

```bash
bash scripts/ios-ship-testflight.sh
```

Fleet: `/Users/jay/apps/ios-fleet/README.md`. Bundles `services.jays.usage.client.monitor` (Usage Client Monitor) + `services.jays.usage.local.monitor` (Usage Local Monitor), team `CC8UTF7ATG`.

## Theme default = light (owner 2026-08-10)

Default product theme is **light** for all fleet apps. Do not ship dark-first or system defaults that land on dark. See `/Users/jay/apps/FLEET-UI-COPY.md` and `/Users/jay/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md`.

## Fleet UI copy

Owner copy rules (Title Case headings/buttons; sentence-case values; lowercase compact money; always-inline iOS nav titles; ticker logos): `docs/FLEET-UI-COPY.md` (canonical live board: `/Users/jay/apps/FLEET-UI-COPY.md`).

## Apple Notes close-out (all agents, all apps — 2026-08-09)

**Title:** `[APP, Agent] short topic` — app acronym(s) + agent **first**.
Examples: `[UM, Grok] TestFlight first ship` · `[ST, CT, Monet] R2 peer digests`.
Acronyms: `UM` `ST` `CT` `CTS` `FLEET`. Multi-app: list each (`[ST, CT, Grok] …`).
Agent display Title Case (`Grok`/`Monet`/`Claude`/…), not ALL-CAPS Slack tags.

**Second body row:** local stamp `Sun, Aug 9, 3:52pm` (create **or** last update —
refresh on every change). Helper auto-injects/refreshes it.

**Always** write/update living Completion notes for substantial work; update in place.
Folder **Coding**, pin when able. Helper: `/Users/jay/apps/apple-notes-coding.sh`
(`--update`). Canonical: `/Users/jay/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` § Apple Notes.

## Two spaces between sentences (owner — ALL contexts)

Two spaces after sentence terminators in **all** human-readable prose for every
agent: web, PWA, iOS UI, **every App Store Connect field** (description,
promotional text, What's New, **App Review notes**, **IAP / subscription
review notes**, subscription localization descriptions), push/email, help,
privacy, owner Notes.  HTML must preserve the gap (NBSP+space / SENTENCE_GAP).
Store listing copy must be accurate (corpus, trial length).

**Strengthened 2026-08-19 (owner, in-conversation):** not limited to product copy —
covers every paragraph an agent writes anywhere, including **chat replies to the
owner**, PR titles/bodies, commit messages, Slack posts to #agent-sync, Apple Notes,
effort-board rows, rollout notes, review reports, and design docs.  If it's prose a
human reads, it gets two spaces.

Canonical: `/Users/jay/apps/AGENT-SYNC.md` § Two spaces and `/Users/jay/apps/FLEET-UI-COPY.md`.

**HOW to emit it so it's actually visible (verified 2026-08-19, Socratic.Trade
PR #2893):** intent is not enough, the gap has to survive the renderer.  In a
**chat reply** (Claude Code terminal/desktop transcript, any agent chat UI), type
the literal HTML entity text `&nbsp;` right after the period, then a normal space
— `Sentence one.&nbsp; Sentence two.` — the markdown renderer expands the entity
into a visibly wider gap.  Tested and confirmed NOT to work in chat: two literal
spaces (collapsed by GitHub-flavored markdown); a raw U+00A0 character typed
directly (normalized away in the transcript view even though copy-paste out of it
can look right).  In a **file** (read as source, never through that renderer),
literal two ASCII spaces stays correct — do not switch file content to NBSP or
`&nbsp;`.
