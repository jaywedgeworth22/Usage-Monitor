### Description

```
Usage Client Monitor is the iOS companion for a Usage Monitor server you host.

See month-to-date API spend, budgets, and alerts without living in a browser tab. Point the app at your server URL, store a read token in the Keychain, and keep budgets on your Lock Screen and Home Screen widgets.

WHAT IT DOES
• Live Overview — spent this month, budget pace, and projected end-of-month
• Providers — per-provider spend, budgets, and detail history
• Project budgets — allocate cost across the work that matters
• Alerts — budget warnings and exceedances, with optional local notifications
• Face ID / passcode lock so money figures stay private on a shared device
• Offline cache + widgets after the first successful sync

WHO IT IS FOR
Operators who already run (or will run) Usage Monitor on their own infrastructure — including the open/self-host path documented with the project. This app is a client. It does not replace hosting the server.

WHAT YOU NEED
• A reachable Usage Monitor base URL (HTTPS)
• A read or full-access token issued by that server

Privacy-minded: the developer does not receive your traffic unless you choose a server they operate. Your token stays in the device Keychain.

Not a brokerage, bank, or tax product — developer tooling for API cost visibility.
```

### Keywords (≤100 chars, comma-separated, no spaces after commas preferred)

```
api,budget,cost,usage,openai,anthropic,llm,devops,monitor,self-host,spend
```

### What's New (1.0)

```
Initial App Store release of Usage Client Monitor — live budgets, providers, project allocation, alerts, Face ID lock, and widgets for your self-hosted Usage Monitor server.
```

### App Review notes

```
This is a client for a self-hosted Usage Monitor server (developer tools).

No public demo account is required for binary smoke checks: launch shows Settings connection fields when no token is stored.

To exercise live data (optional):
1. Set Base URL to the reviewer’s own Usage Monitor instance, OR
2. Contact mail@jays.services for a short-lived read-only review host if needed.

Face ID is optional (Settings → App Lock). Disable App Lock for review if preferred.

Encryption: standard HTTPS + Keychain only; ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption is false.
```

### Privacy nutrition (Client)

| Category | Collected? | Linked to identity? | Tracking? | Notes |
|----------|------------|---------------------|-----------|-------|
| Contact Info | No (in-app) | — | No | Support via email only |
| Financial Info | Yes (usage $ from *user's* server) | No app account | No | Processed on device after fetch; not sold |
| Sensitive Info / credentials | Token in Keychain | No | No | User-supplied server token |
| Identifiers | No advertising ID | — | No | |
| Usage Data | No analytics SDK | — | No | |
| Diagnostics | No third-party crash SDK in app | — | No | |

Declare data types only if the app *by design* sends them off-device: budget JSON goes to **user-configured** server host. If ASC requires “sent off device”, classify as Financial Info / Other User Content to **app functionality** with “not linked / not used for tracking”, purpose App Functionality.

## 2) Usage Local Monitor

| **App info localization** | `2d225776-d637-483e-aa1a-690f4b40e3fb` |
| **Subtitle** (≤30) | On-device API budget tracker |
| **Promotional text** | Track OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, and more on your phone — keys in Keychain, budgets in on-device SQLite. No Usage Monitor server required. |

### Description

```
Usage Local Monitor keeps API and subscription spend visible on your iPhone — entirely on-device.

Add the providers you already pay for, store keys in the Keychain, and see month-to-date cost, budgets, renewals, and alerts without running a separate server.

WHAT IT DOES
• On-device Overview — spent this month, budget remaining, projected end-of-month
• Provider catalog aligned with real developer stacks (LLM, hosting, data, infra)
• Poll adapters where providers expose cost or balance APIs (for example OpenRouter, OpenAI org costs, Anthropic Admin cost report, DeepSeek balance)
• Recurring fees as subscriptions that materialize into the same spend totals
• Projects — optional budgets for each effort
• Export / import packages (keys never included in exports)
• Face ID / passcode lock
• Wipe local data when you want a clean slate

WHO IT IS FOR
Individual developers and small teams who want phone-first cost awareness without hosting Usage Monitor.

WHAT IT IS NOT
• Not a remote dashboard client (that is Usage Client Monitor)
• Not a bank, brokerage, or tax product
• Does not invent spend for providers that only offer console billing — those stay as subscription or manual rows

Privacy-minded: processing is on-device. Keys leave the device only over HTTPS to providers you choose.
```

### Keywords

```
api,budget,cost,openai,anthropic,openrouter,llm,local,on-device,usage,spend
```

### What's New (1.0)

```
Initial App Store release of Usage Local Monitor — on-device budgets, provider catalog, poll adapters, subscriptions, projects, export/import, and Face ID lock. No server required.
```

### App Review notes

```
On-device developer tools app. No login and no developer-operated backend.

First launch seeds an empty/local catalog. To see non-zero month-to-date cost:
1. Add Provider → choose OpenRouter (or similar)
2. Paste a management/provisioning key if the provider requires it for cost APIs
3. Pull to refresh

Inference-only keys may show connected without MTD cost — expected.

Optional: use Settings wipe to clear demo data.

Face ID is optional. Encryption is standard HTTPS + Keychain only.

Screenshot builds may use -ScreenshotDemo fixture data; production App Store binaries do not require that flag.
```

### Privacy nutrition (Local)

| Category | Collected by developer? | Notes |
|----------|-------------------------|-------|
| Financial Info | Processed on device; not transmitted to developer | User’s provider cost figures |
| Sensitive Info | Keys in Keychain; sent only to user-chosen providers | |
| Tracking | No | |
| Analytics / Ads | No | |
| Contact Info | No in-app collection | |

App Privacy form: typically **Data Not Collected** *by the developer* if no developer backend receives data. Disclose that the app contacts third-party APIs the user configures (purpose: App Functionality). Prefer accurate “data not collected [by us]” when no developer endpoint is involved.
