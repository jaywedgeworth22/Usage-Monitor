/// They are deliberately separate `LoadState`s rather than one combined fetch:
/// `/api/platform-status`, `/api/server-metrics` and `/api/operations` fail
/// independently upstream, and an operator looking at this screen during an
/// incident needs whichever ones still answer.  One dead endpoint must never
/// blank the other two.

/// Follows `Settings/HostUsageStore` exactly: probes are injectable for tests,
/// the client is passed per call (so switching hosts just passes a new client),
/// and a refresh failure keeps the previously loaded value rather than
/// replacing good data with an error.
