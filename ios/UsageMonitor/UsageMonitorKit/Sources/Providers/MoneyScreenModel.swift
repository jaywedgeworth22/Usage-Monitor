// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The Money screen's data layer, kept deliberately separate from the view so
// the money math (what counts toward the recurring total, what reads as "not
// budgeted", how a renewal date is worded) is unit-testable without SwiftUI.
//
// TWO sources, because the monitor has two equally valid ways to model a
// recurring fee and a total that reads only one of them is wrong:
//
//   1. `GET /api/subscriptions` — bearer-readable.  Tracked plans, each already
//      carrying its provider reference, monthly-equivalent cost, and next
//      renewal timestamp.
//   2. `GET /api/providers?view=dashboard` — dashboard-session-only.  Carries
//      `ProviderPlan.fixedMonthlyCostUsd`, a recurring fee recorded straight on
//      the provider instead of as a Subscription.  The web Money page reads
//      both for exactly this reason (`src/components/MoneyPageClient.tsx`).
//
// The two loads are INDEPENDENT.  A read-token-only user still gets the whole
// subscription half; the session-only half degrades to the established "Full
// Dashboard Access Required → Open Settings" affordance, and the screen says
// out loud that plan-level fees are missing rather than quietly understating
// the total.
//
// Double-counting is prevented the same way `src/lib/billing-inventory.ts`
// does it: a provider's plan-level fee is a FALLBACK, dropped entirely once
// that provider has an active tracked subscription.
